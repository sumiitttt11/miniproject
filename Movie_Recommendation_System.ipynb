Here's a detailed explanation:\n","\n","1. **Library Imports and Data Loading:**\n","The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy TfidfVectorizer from sklearn for text processing, and cosine_similarity for measuring similarity between movies. difflib is used to find close matches for movie names.\n","A dataset of movies is loaded using pd.read_csv() from a URL containing various features like movie genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and director.\n","The movie.head() function previews the first five rows of the dataset.\n","2. **Feature Extraction and TF-IDF Transformation:**\n","The important features for recommendation are selected: Movie_Genre, Movie_Keywords, Movie_Tagline, Movie_Cast, and Movie_Director. These columns are combined into a single feature vector x after handling missing values using .fillna('').\n","The TfidfVectorizer() is applied to transform this combined textual data into numerical vectors (TF-IDF), which represent the importance of each word within the context of a document.\n","The cosine similarity is computed between the TF-IDF vectors, resulting in a similarity matrix (Similarity_Score), where each entry represents the similarity score between two movies.\n","3. **User Input and Closest Match:**\n","The user is prompted to input their favorite movie name, and all movie titles from the dataset are stored in a list All_Movies_Title_List.\n","Using difflib.get_close_matches(), the code finds the closest movie title match to the user's input. If a close match is found, it identifies the matching movie and retrieves its corresponding index (Index_of_Close_Match_Movie).\n","4. **Recommendation Based on Similarity:**\n","Once the closest match is found, the recommendation scores of other movies in relation to this matched movie are calculated by retrieving the similarity scores from Similarity_Score.\n","The movies are then sorted in descending order based on their similarity to the matched movie (Sorted_Similar_Movies).\n","5. **Displaying the Recommendations:**\n","Finally, the top 30 most similar movies are displayed to the user. The code iterates through the sorted movie list, retrieving the title of each recommended movie by its index and printing the recommendations.\n","This system allows users to input a movie they like, and based on the features of that movie, it recommends similar ones from the dataset. The use of cosine similarity ensures that movies with similar content, keywords, and cast are suggested to the user."],"metadata":{"id":"Ybi8FR9Kjv00"}}]}
